RTS
===

A pygame RTS. Click onscreen buttons to place different buildings, WASD or arrow keys to move the camera, RMB and drag to select trees for choppin'.
At the moment there is little longterm gameplay, more just a demo of the basic UI and the hunger and building mechanics.
Feedback would be much appreciated! Message me on Reddit, I'm /u/jellyberg
