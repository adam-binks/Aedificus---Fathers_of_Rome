### Installation

You can download an .exe [here](http://www.mediafire.com/download/s1c7fl8d8rnie25/Aedificus_1.0_win.zip)

If you're one of those Appley folk, you can grab the Mac .app [here](http://www.mediafire.com/download/c3891f0uqo06kou/Aedificus_1.0_mac.zip)

Once you've downloaded that, just right click the .zip, click Extract All, then when that's done you can run main.exe or main.app, depending on your platform obviously.


Alternatively, if you have Python and Pygame installed, just download the .zip, extract all, then run libengine.py

### The game

A pygame real time strategy game. Move the camera with WASD/mouse, pause/unpause with SPACE, mute/unmute with M.

At the moment the game is incomplete, but there may be fun to be had experimenting, building, and mercilessly slaughtering your innocent citizens.

Feedback would be much appreciated! Message me on here or on Reddit - I'm /u/jellyberg.

If things are running below 35 FPS on your machine, try lowering animal count as they have no effect on gameplay.
