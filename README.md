RTS
===

A pygame RTS. Click onscreen buttons to place different buildings, WASD or arrow keys to move the camera, RMB and drag to select trees or ores for choppin'.
At the moment there is little longterm gameplay, more just a demo of the basic UI and the hunger and building mechanics.
Feedback would be much appreciated! Message me on Reddit, I'm /u/jellyberg

If things are running below 35 FPS on your machine, try lowering animal count as they have no effect on gameplay.
